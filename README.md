# 204_ducks_2019
Epitech Maths Project

When ducks are disturbed by a sudden noise, they fly away almost simultaneously, leaving the pond empty.
Chances that a duck will then come back after t minutes are given by the following probability density
function:

    f : [0, +∞[ −→ R

    t 7−→ ae −t + (4 − 3a)e −2t + (2a − 4)e −4t

where a is a real constant between 0 and 2.5, which depends on external factors (such as temperature, day
time, duck’s health etc.).

A study is being conducted about these ducks, and you are asked to compute and display the following,
given the value of a:

1. The average time after which ducks come back,

2. The standard deviation of the ducks’ return time,

3. The time after which 50% of all of the ducks are back,

4. The time after which 99% of all of the ducks are back,

5. The percentage of ducks that come back after 1 minute,

6. The percentage of ducks that come back after 2 minutes.
